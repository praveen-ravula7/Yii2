## Implementation Details

Let me explain some of the key technical decisions and components in this solution:

### Docker Setup

I've structured the Dockerfile to create an efficient container for running the Yii2 application:

1. **Base Image**: Using `php:8.2-fpm` as it provides PHP-FPM which works well with NGINX
2. **Dependencies**: Installing only necessary system packages and PHP extensions
3. **Composer**: Including Composer for dependency management
4. **Application Source**: For this example, pulling the basic Yii2 application template (in a real scenario, this would come from your Git repository)
5. **Permissions**: Setting appropriate permissions for runtime directories

The Docker Compose file includes:

1. **Replicated Services**: Two replicas of the application for high availability
2. **Health Checks**: To ensure containers are running properly
3. **Update Config**: Rolling updates with `start-first` to prevent downtime
4. **Persistent Volumes**: For both application data and database
5. **Overlay Network**: For secure communication between services

### NGINX Reverse Proxy

The NGINX configuration:

1. Runs on the host (not in a container) as specified in the requirements
2. Proxies requests to the Swarm services using their service names
3. Includes optimizations for static assets and security configurations
4. Uses upstream fastcgi connections to the PHP-FPM containers

### Ansible Automation

The Ansible playbook handles the entire infrastructure setup:

1. **System Packages**: Installing required dependencies
2. **Docker Installation**: Setting up Docker and Docker Compose
3. **Swarm Initialization**: Configuring Docker Swarm mode
4. **NGINX Setup**: Installing and configuring NGINX as a reverse proxy
5. **Application Deployment**: Deploying the application to the Swarm

For the monitoring setup (bonus), I've added:

1. **Prometheus**: For metrics collection and storage
2. **Node Exporter**: For system-level metrics
3. **Docker Metrics**: Configuring Docker to expose metrics
4. **Systemd Services**: For reliable operation of monitoring tools

### CI/CD Pipeline

The GitHub Actions workflow implements a complete CI/CD pipeline:

1. **Build**: Creating the Docker image with caching for faster builds
2. **Push**: Publishing to Docker Hub or GitHub Container Registry
3. **Deploy**: Updating the Swarm service with the new image
4. **Verification**: Checking that the deployment succeeded
5. **Rollback**: Automatic rollback if the deployment fails

The workflow uses GitHub Secrets for secure handling of credentials and sensitive information.

## Best Practices Applied

This solution incorporates several DevOps best practices:

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: Everything is defined in code and can be version-controlled
2. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Using containers that are replaced rather than modified
3. **Automated Testing**: Verifying deployments before considering them successful
4. **High Availability**: Multiple replicas and health checks for reliability
5. **Security**: Using secrets management and least privilege principles
6. **Monitoring**: Setting up observability tools from the start
7. **Idempotent Operations**: Ansible playbooks can be run multiple times safely

## Future Enhancements

While this solution meets all the requirements, here are some potential improvements for future consideration:

1. **SSL/TLS**: Add HTTPS support with Let's Encrypt certificates
2. **Blue-Green Deployments**: Implement more sophisticated deployment strategies
3. **Database Migrations**: Add automated database schema migrations
4. **Backup/Restore**: Implement automated backup procedures
5. **Log Aggregation**: Add a centralized logging solution like ELK stack
6. **Auto-scaling**: Configure Docker Swarm to scale based on load
7. **Alerting**: Configure Prometheus alerts for system and application issues

## Usage Scenarios

This setup provides a solid foundation for different use cases:

1. **Development Environments**: Quickly spin up consistent development environments
2. **Testing**: Create identical test environments for QA
3. **Production**: Deploy to multiple production servers with the same configuration
4. **Multi-environment**: Use Ansible variables to customize for dev/stage/prod

By following the instructions in the README, you can easily customize this solution for your specific Yii2 application and deploy it to your AWS EC2 instances with confidence.
